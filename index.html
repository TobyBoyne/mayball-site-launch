        <p>
          Downing May Ball is one of several biennial May Balls held in
          Cambridge to help students celebrate the end of their exams. The May
          Balls are one of the most iconic traditions and Downing is proud to
          hold one of the most extensive and extravagant May Balls in the
          Cambridge calendar, doing our bit to keep the tradition alive and help
          students from all walks of life create long-lasting memories of their
          Cambridge experience.
          <br /><br />
          The Downing May Ball is held on the historic site of Downing College,
          set on seventeen acres in the heart of Cambridge. With few enclosed
          courts and plenty of green space, Downing May Ball is almost unique in
          the opportunities it offers to guests to move freely around the space
          and take in the whole Ball from its Quadrangle and Paddock.
          <br /><br />
          Nevertheless, the Downing May ball will boast more than six uniquely
          themed areas, dozens of food and drinks options, and three stages
          where acts will perform throughout the night from 8:30pm all the way
          through to 5:30am the next day. With former Headliners including Becky
          Hill and Scouting for Girls, the 2022 May Ball promises entertainment
          delights that are certainly not to be missed! Please keep your eyes
          attuned to this space for the release of our Entertainments program
          and the reveal of our Site Plan.

          The 2022 May Ball Theme is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. This was
          originally the theme for the 2021 May Ball, which was cancelled due to
          the Coronavirus Pandemic. We feel that this theme is even more apt in
          2022. During the pandemic, more than ever before, we turned to
          streaming and movies for an escape from our new reality. This is what
          the 2022 May Ball is all about. For one night only join us at the
          fictional ‘DMB Studios’ as we take you on a tour of the offerings of
          Classic Hollywood; Science Fiction, Spaghetti Western, Espionage,
          Romance, and more. We can’t wait to see you there!

        <h2 id="ecoaccess-title">Access and Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
          The Downing May Ball is committed to access and sustainability and is
          taking part in both the Access-a-Ball and Sustain-a-Ball accreditation
          schemes for this year’s event. <br /><br />
          For sustainability, we embed sustainability and environmental
          consciousness in all parts of the planning process. We have already
          taken steps to minimize waste, ensure the majority of food options are
          vegetarian, sourcing locally wherever possible, and sharing resources
          with other Balls. We cannot wait to show you what more we have in
          store to make this event as sustainable as possible!
          <br /><br />
          Improving accessibility in all parts of the planning process of the
          Ball so that as many people can enjoy the event as possible is a
          priority. When an unanticipated access need or a specific request is
          raised, we will do everything we can to accommodate and make that
          person feel welcome, getting advice from DSC if unsure how to proceed.
          Please email ecoaccess@downingball.co.uk and/or
          president@downingball.co.uk if any of these concerns arise!
